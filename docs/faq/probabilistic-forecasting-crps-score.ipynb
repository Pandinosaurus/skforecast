    "In point estimate forecasting, the model outputs a single value that ideally represents the most likely value of the time series at future steps. In this scenario, the quality of the predictions can be assessed by comparing the predicted value with the true value of the series. Examples of metrics used for this purpose are the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).\n",
    "\n",
    "In probabilistic forecasting, however, the model does not produce a single value, but rather a representation of the entire distribution of possible predicted values. In practice, this is often represented by a sample of the underlying distribution (e.g. 50 possible predicted values) or by specific quantiles that capture most of the information in the distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the main applications of probabilistic forecasting is the estimation of prediction intervals - ranges within which the actual value is expected to fall with a certain probability. In this case, the model should aim to achieve the desired coverage (e.g. 80%) while minimising the width of the prediction interval.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Continuous Ranked Probability Score (CRPS) is a generalisation of the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) tailored to probabilistic forecasting. Unlike the MAE, which compares point predictions to observations, the CRPS evaluates the accuracy of an entire predicted probability distribution against the observed value. It does this by comparing the empirical cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the predicted values with the step-function CDF of the true value. \n",
    "\n",
    "Two key components of the CRPS are the empirical CDF of the predicted values, ùêπ(ùë¶), and the CDF of the observed value, ùêª(ùë¶). The CRPS is then calculated as the integral of the squared difference between these two functions over the entire real line:\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Empirical CDF of the forecast, $F(y)$: This is constructed from the ensemble of predicted values. Each predicted value contributes a \"step\" in the cumulative distribution. The predicted values are therefore treated  as a sample of the underlying probability distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "+ CDF of the observed Value, $H(y)$: This is a step function that transitions from 0 to 1 at the true observed value. It represents the probability that the observed value falls below a given threshold.\n",
    "\n",
    "The CRPS measures the area between the two CDFs, $F(y)$ and $H(y)$, across all possible values of $y$. Mathematically, it is expressed as:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\text{CRPS}(F, H) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\big(F(y) - H(y)\\big)^2 \\, dy$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This integral quantifies the squared difference between the forecasted and observed distributions. \n",
    "\n",
    "The CRPS can be computed for a single observation or for a set of observations. In the latter case, the CRPS is averaged over all observations to provide a summary measure of the model's performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "CRPS is widely used in probabilistic forecasting because it provides a unified framework for evaluating both the sharpness (narrowness) and calibration (accuracy) of predictive distributions. By doing so, it ensures that models are not only accurate in their point predictions but also appropriately represent uncertainty. Smaller values of CRPS indicate a better match between the forecast and the observed outcome."
